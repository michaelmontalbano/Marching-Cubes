This project creates graphs out of 3D data 
And uses these features to predict
the size of hail

note: the prediction scheme could be improved, perhaps with a GNN (graph neural network). 
our method was to use statistical information about the graphs as input 
to our neural networks.

Volumizer.py - main file, does data augmentation and builds dataset. 
Other files 

This was my first data science project. It's very cool, but there are some deficiencies 
in the implementation.
